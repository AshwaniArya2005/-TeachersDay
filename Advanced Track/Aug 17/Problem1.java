    // In Jzzhuâ€™s school, there are n children each needing at least a certain
    // number of candies. The children line up, and in each turn the first child in
    // the queue receives m candies. If their requirement is still not satisfied,
    // they move to the end of the line; otherwise, they leave the queue and go
    // home. This process repeats until all children leave, and the problem is to
    // determine which child will be the very last one to go home.
