    // a plan for n days where he eats one meal per day. Meals of type 1 must be
    // eaten from a bowl, while meals of type 2 can be eaten from either a bowl or a
    // plate. Each time Valera doesnâ€™t have the required clean utensil, he must wash
    // one before eating. The problem is to calculate the minimum number of times he
    // will need to wash dishes if he uses his utensils in the most efficient way
    // possible.
